                        <p>We found each other on a summer evening, opposites attracting in an unusual place.</p>
                        
                        <p>First she found me. I had just unknowingly missed my 10-year high school reunion and instead found myself in a
                        neighborhood bar with my good friend Gary, though not our usual place. Jenny, on a bachelorette party scavenger hunt,
                        approached us thinking Gary was bald under his beanie and she could cross one more item off of her list. Instead, her
                        and I traded smiles and some flirtatious glances as a few of us shared a quick drink and friendly conversation over the
                        deafening music. I walked home with nothing but her name and maybe an extra skip in my step, but it was a good night.</p>
                        
                        <p>Then I found her. In a sea of online profiles, a newly familiar smile and that amazing, beautiful name. Jenny.</p>
                        
                        <p>You probably won’t be surprised to read that our first date was awkward. At that time, I had no idea what I was looking
                        for and I definitely wasn’t the kind of person, at least on paper, that she had in mind. For a long while I know we both
                        felt real uncertainty, but for some strange reason we liked each other and always agreed that we should keep at it.
                        After a few months, my friends were telling me I looked happy for the first time in ages.</p>
                        
                        <p>Soon enough, it just clicked for me and I knew I actually loved Jenny. When I told her (and heard the same in return), I
                        was honestly overcome with emotion, though I probably didn’t show very much of it. I just know I felt a sense of peace
                        and purpose, and after that the uncertainty was gone.</p>
                        
                        <p>In the following few years we shared some wonderful, and some trying, experiences: meeting each others’ families, moving
                        (kind of) to Portland, traveling together, making Christmas music, and moving to Minneapolis. More recently we’ve really
                        invested in our family by buying our first house together and adding a puppy (George) into the mix.</p>
                        
                        <p>This past summer, Jenny and I took George camping in a scenic state park not too far away. As we sat by the campfire, I
                        tried over two nights to find the right time to propose but nervously just made our conversations awkward. On the second
                        night, however, I knew it was the right time. I got up from my seat, knelt by Jenny’s side, told her I loved her, and
                        asked her to marry me. It wasn’t well planned, but it ended up being a perfect moment.</p>
                        
                        <p>As our wedding day approaches, I can’t help but be hopeful. We’ve always been awkward, and our plans have changed, but
                        we’ve always found a way to make it work perfectly together. I can’t wait to share another beautiful experience with
                        Jenny and the people we care about most.</p>

                        <p>In 2015, sometime in early August, I was attending the bachelorette party for one of my sweet and fun college roommates.
                        That night, we visited a few places in Seattle and were tasked with completing some scavenger hunt items while we were
                        out on the town. We ended up at The Unicorn- which I now recall as a crowded and colorful place to get a good corn dog.
                        It was my first time there and I was searching for a bald person so I could ask if it was okay to rub their head (see
                        aforementioned scavenger hunt- I don’t have a good answer as to why that was a task). And that’s how I met Thomas!</p>
            
                        <p>Is he bald? Nope, not at all. But he was with a friend that had the possibility of being bald underneath a beanie. It
                        turns out he was also not bald but that’s why I approached them. I ended up talking to them for a while and learned lots
                        of fun facts about “Tom” through the hometown friend he was with. I learned later he is not one to share a lot of
                        details, so I think meeting his friend first helped break the ice quite a bit. The bachelorette party moved on soon
                        after that to continue on our hunt at another place, and I did not exchange any phone numbers or details with Thomas.
                        The next day I remember telling my friends that I thought the guy with glasses was cute, and also quite short.</p>
            
                        <p>This was also during my online dating season, which was not at all successful. However, I did still have an active
                        profile on a couple of sites and got a surprise message from “Thomas”. I wish I knew what that first message said now-
                        probably something along the lines of “I met you the other night.” Very matter-of-fact. I do remember my response was
                        “Hi Tom!!!!!!” with probably a few too many exclamation points, but I was excited to hear from him! He mentioned that he
                        likes to go by Thomas, something he didn’t correct that first night- but then he became Thomas to me forever, despite
                        the fact that a lot of his family and friends call him Tom.</p>
            
                        <p>We went on a few dates, scattered with a fair amount of awkward nodding and nervous smiles from both of us. I can still
                        picture his kind blue eyes and little chuckles as I did a lot of talking and attempted to dig into all that is Thomas.
                        Those dates turned into a few more, and those turned into a few more (coffee, Thai food, sushi, more coffee). He’s not
                        the easiest person to get to know quickly 😉, but I appreciate that about him too. I feel pretty lucky to be a person
                        that knows him as well as I do.</p>
            
                        <p>Eventually I think we realized that we have one big thing in common- a feeling of being a little bit on the outside of
                        “normal” and that’s what drew me in. As we continued our relationship, I learned he is such a supportive listener,
                        extremely kind and smart, and the most consistent person I know. He’s stuck with me through the ordinary days, the days
                        of figuring out who I wanted/ want to be, the emotional days, a move to Portland, a move to Minneapolis, new careers,
                        buying a home together, raising a puppy. And after all of that, we’re finally ready to make it official- six years later
                        in early August. I’m so thankful to have found him and I can’t wait to finally call him my husband; a title I think he
                        has already proved worthy of for a long time.</p>
