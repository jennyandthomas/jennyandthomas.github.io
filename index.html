                        <p>We found each other on a summer evening, opposites attracting in an unusual place.</p>
                        
                        <p>First she found me. I had just unknowingly missed my 10-year high school reunion and instead found myself in a
                        neighborhood bar with my good friend Gary, though not our usual place. Jenny, on a bachelorette party scavenger hunt,
                        approached us thinking Gary was bald under his beanie and she could cross one more item off of her list. Instead, her
                        and I traded smiles and some flirtatious glances as a few of us shared a quick drink and friendly conversation over the
                        deafening music. I walked home with nothing but her name and maybe an extra skip in my step, but it was a good night.</p>
                        
                        <p>Then I found her. In a sea of online profiles, a newly familiar smile and that amazing, beautiful name. Jenny.</p>
                        
                        <p>You probably won’t be surprised to read that our first date was awkward. At that time, I had no idea what I was looking
                        for and I definitely wasn’t the kind of person, at least on paper, that she had in mind. For a long while I know we both
                        felt real uncertainty, but for some strange reason we liked each other and always agreed that we should keep at it.
                        After a few months, my friends were telling me I looked happy for the first time in ages.</p>
                        
                        <p>Soon enough, it just clicked for me and I knew I actually loved Jenny. When I told her (and heard the same in return), I
                        was honestly overcome with emotion, though I probably didn’t show very much of it. I just know I felt a sense of peace
                        and purpose, and after that the uncertainty was gone.</p>
                        
                        <p>In the following few years we shared some wonderful, and some trying, experiences: meeting each others’ families, moving
                        (kind of) to Portland, traveling together, making Christmas music, and moving to Minneapolis. More recently we’ve really
                        invested in our family by buying our first house together and adding a puppy (George) into the mix.</p>
                        
                        <p>This past summer, Jenny and I took George camping in a scenic state park not too far away. As we sat by the campfire, I
                        tried over two nights to find the right time to propose but nervously just made our conversations awkward. On the second
                        night, however, I knew it was the right time. I got up from my seat, knelt by Jenny’s side, told her I loved her, and
                        asked her to marry me. It wasn’t well planned, but it ended up being a perfect moment.</p>
                        
                        <p>As our wedding day approaches, I can’t help but be hopeful. We’ve always been awkward, and our plans have changed, but
                        we’ve always found a way to make it work perfectly together. I can’t wait to share another beautiful experience with
                        Jenny and the people we care about most.</p>

                        <p>In 2015, sometime in early August, I was attending my college roommate’s bachelorette party. That night, we visited a
                        few places in Seattle and were tasked with completing some scavenger hunt items while we were out on the town. We ended
                        up at The Unicorn- which I now recall as a crowded and colorful place to get a good corn dog. It was my first time there
                        and I was searching for a bald person so I could ask if it was okay to rub their head (see aforementioned scavenger
                        hunt- I don’t have a good answer as to why that was a task). And that’s how I met Thomas!</p>
            
                        <p>Is he bald? Nope, not at all, but his friend was wearing a beanie in the middle of summer, so it seemed like a logical
                        place to start. I talked to them for a while and learned some fun facts about “Tom”, mostly offered by the hometown
                        friend he was with. The bachelorette party moved on soon after that to continue our hunt at another place, and I didn’t
                        expect to see him again. The next day I remember telling my friends that I thought Thomas was cute.</p>
            
                        <p>This was also during my online dating season, which was not very fun or successful. However, I did get a surprise
                        message from Thomas shortly after that first meeting. I wish I knew what that first message said now- probably something
                        along the lines of “I met you the other night.” Very matter-of-fact. I do remember my response was “Hi Tom!!!!!!” with
                        probably a few too many exclamation points, but I was excited to hear from him! He mentioned that he likes to go by
                        Thomas, something he didn’t correct that first night. He became Thomas to me forever after that, despite the fact that a
                        lot of his family and friends call him Tom.</p>
            
                        <p>We went on a few dates, scattered with a fair amount of awkward nodding and nervous smiles from both of us. I can still
                        picture his kind blue eyes and little chuckles as I did a lot of talking and attempted to dig into all that is Thomas.
                        Those dates turned into a few more dates and then a few more. Our favorites were coffee, Thai food, sushi, more coffee.</p>
            
                        <p>Eventually we realized that we have a lot in common, even though we’re pretty different. We learned that we’re happiest
                        when we’re together, doing nothing or everything. He’s such a supportive listener and I always have a lot to say. I
                        think that’s what drew me in. As we continued our relationship, I learned that he is extremely kind and smart, and the
                        most consistent person I know. He’s stuck with me through the ordinary days, the days of figuring out who I wanted/ want
                        to be, the emotional days, a move to Portland, a move to Minneapolis, new careers, buying a home together, raising a
                        puppy. And after all of that, we’re finally ready to make it official- six years later in early August. I’m so thankful
                        to have found him and I can’t wait to finally call him my husband; a title I think he has proved worthy of for a long
                        time.</p>
